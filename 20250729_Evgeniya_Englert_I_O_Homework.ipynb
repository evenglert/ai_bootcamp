    "## Instructions:\n",
    "### Your task is to create a Python program that helps manage a bootcamp. \n",
    "### Your program should allow the user to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add a student: The program should prompt the user to enter the student's name, age, and email address. The program should then add the student to the bootcamp's database.\n",
    "* Remove a student: The program should prompt the user to enter the name of the student they want to remove. The program should then remove the student from the database.\n",
    "* View all students: The program should display a list of all the students in the bootcamp, along with their names, ages, and email addresses.\n",
    "* Search for a student: The program should prompt the user to enter the student's name they want to search for. The program should then display the student's information if they are found in the database.\n",
    "* Exit the program: The program should allow the user to exit the program.\n",
    "* Your program should use the input() and print() functions to get input from the user and display output to the user. You should also use lists and dictionaries to store and manipulate data. The database should be read and stored in a file called bootcamp.txt."
